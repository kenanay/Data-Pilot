# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to simplify and clean up the existing Data Pilot application by fixing errors, creating a streamlined single-click localhost connection, removing unnecessary files and dependencies, and establishing a clean user data input structure. The goal is to create a maintainable, efficient application with the same core technologies (FastAPI backend, React frontend) but with improved organization and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start the application with a single command, so that I can quickly test and develop without managing multiple terminal sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs a single startup command THEN the system SHALL start both backend and frontend services simultaneously
2. WHEN the services start THEN the system SHALL automatically open the application in the default browser
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a clear status indicating both services are running
4. IF any service fails to start THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and stop gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unnecessary files and dependencies removed, so that the application is cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the project structure THEN the system SHALL identify and remove duplicate or unused files
2. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the system SHALL remove unused packages from both Python and Node.js configurations
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL preserve all functional code and necessary configurations
4. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same core functionality with fewer files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple HTML interface for data input, so that I can easily enter and manage data without complex navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean, intuitive data input interface
2. WHEN entering data THEN the system SHALL provide form validation and clear feedback
3. WHEN submitting data THEN the system SHALL save the information and confirm successful submission
4. WHEN viewing data THEN the system SHALL display entered information in a readable format
5. IF data entry fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and preserve user input

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all application errors fixed, so that the application runs smoothly without crashes or connection issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL start without any import or configuration errors
2. WHEN connecting to localhost THEN the system SHALL establish connections successfully on the first attempt
3. WHEN using any feature THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without connection issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a unified interface, so that I can access all functionality from a single entry point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the root URL THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive dashboard or main interface
2. WHEN navigating the application THEN the system SHALL provide consistent UI/UX across all pages
3. WHEN using different features THEN the system SHALL maintain the same design language and interaction patterns
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display all available functionality clearly

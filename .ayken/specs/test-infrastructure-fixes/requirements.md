# Test Infrastructure Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The frontend test suite is currently failing due to ES module import issues, missing dependencies, and configuration problems. This spec addresses the critical testing infrastructure issues that are blocking development and preventing proper test execution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to run without ES module import errors, so that I can validate my code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm test` THEN the system SHALL execute tests without ERR_REQUIRE_ESM errors
2. WHEN importing ES modules in tests THEN the system SHALL properly resolve module dependencies
3. WHEN using vi.mock() THEN the system SHALL correctly mock ES modules without import conflicts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test dependencies to be properly configured, so that testing libraries work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests use @testing-library/react THEN the system SHALL render components without errors
2. WHEN tests use vitest mocking THEN the system SHALL properly mock modules and functions
3. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL have access to all required testing utilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test mocks to work correctly, so that I can test components in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mocking API services THEN the system SHALL prevent actual API calls during tests
2. WHEN mocking hooks THEN the system SHALL provide predictable mock implementations
3. WHEN mocking external dependencies THEN the system SHALL isolate component logic for testing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test assertions to match actual component behavior, so that tests accurately validate functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing component rendering THEN assertions SHALL match the actual DOM output
2. WHEN testing user interactions THEN the system SHALL properly simulate user events
3. WHEN testing async operations THEN the system SHALL handle promises and async state correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test configuration to support the project's ES module setup, so that tests run in the same environment as the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vitest runs THEN the system SHALL use the same module resolution as the application
2. WHEN tests import components THEN the system SHALL resolve .jsx extensions correctly
3. WHEN tests use modern JavaScript features THEN the system SHALL transpile code appropriately

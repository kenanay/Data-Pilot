- **Windows**: `run_tests.bat`
- **Linux/Mac**: `./run_tests.sh`

These scripts will:
1. Check if the application is running and start it if necessary
2. Run all unit tests
3. Run all integration tests
4. Run all end-to-end tests
5. Generate test reports in the `logs` directory

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated in the `logs` directory:

- `unit_tests.log`: Results of unit tests
- `integration_tests.log`: Results of integration tests
- `e2e_tests.log`: Results of end-to-end tests

Review these reports to identify any issues that need to be addressed.
